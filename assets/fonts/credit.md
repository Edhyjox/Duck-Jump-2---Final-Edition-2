Thanks for Downloading Setback.


-Setback TT     [.ttf]
-Setback [11pt] [.fon]

  'Setback.fon' is a Windows Bitmap Font (.fon).  This font is best
used at 11pt.  To use it at larger point sizes (for images), try using
a graphics program like Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or the Paint
program that comes with Windows.  Type out your text at the recommended
point size [11pt], then resize the image.   Set the color mode to 256
or 2 colors so the edges don't get blured when resizing, then after you
have the text to the size that you want, then change back to a higher
color mode and edit the image.

  For programs that don't show Bitmap Fonts in the Font Selector, you
may be able to get the font to work by typing in:
setback -brk-
